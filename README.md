Create a full stack application that will send a request to a server
and the server will return the search results from three search engines. (In this case google bing and yahoo) 


Expansion plans:

1) Get clicks on google links working correctly. 
2) use MVC framework (instead of returning raw HTML to render)
3) Add Unit Testing framework 
4) get more results from each page (i.e., click on the next page link)
5) use grunt
